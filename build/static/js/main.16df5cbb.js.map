Brain scans show their cerebrums are perfectly normal, if not extraordinary. Dyslexics, in fact, seem to have a distinct advantage when it comes to thinking outside the box. But a growing body of scientific evidence suggests that there is a glitch in the neurological wiring of dyslexics that makes the reading extremely difficult for them. Fortunately, the science also points to new strategies for overcoming the glitch.

Her reading problems had always been attributed to ESOL since she was adopted from China at age 6 years. She was finally diagnosed in 5th grade and was barely reading at a second grade level. It was devastating \\u2013 and like many parents of LD children, I didn\\u2019t know where to turn. I was scared my daughter would never be able to read. I will always be grateful to Joan Collins, director of SpellRead of Greater Baltimore, for her infinite wisdom, vast experience, and proficient knowledge. She gave me hope and Spell Read gave my daughter the gift of reading. Spell Read  WORKS!!! I was amazed at my daughter\\u2019s quick and consistent progress.  After completing the program, Molly was reading at grade level and her word attack skills tested at the upper high school level. She is now in an advanced middle school curriculum and doing very well. She would never be at this point without Spell Read.  I would highly recommend this outstanding program. I wish that every child with a reading disability could experience the same gift that my daughter did \\u2013 the belief in herself, and in her future.', 'My son, Griffin, struggled with reading...\\n\\nIn first grade Griffin was doing well in all aspects of school, except for reading. Watching his classmates progress through the reading levels while he was not caused his self-confidence to dwindle. Griffin was diagnosed with dyslexia. We placed him in a school for children with learning differences, that taught the Orton-Gillingham reading program. Although, Griffin did start progressing, it was a long, frustrating process.\\n\\nAt the beginning of third grade Griffin\\u2019s reading level was that of a second grader. He started the SpellRead program towards the end of September and by the beginning of March he was at a fourth grade reading level! He tackled two grade levels in six months!\\n\\nGriffin was able to return to mainstream school, reading at the level of his classmates. His self-confidence is back and he is a happy child that loves to read.\\n\\nSpellRead is an amazing program that we were fortunate enough to discover. I truly believe that without this program Griffin would still be struggling with reading and feeling frustrated about the whole learning process.', 'Educate from the Latin \"educare\" <related to \"educere\"> meaning to lead forth.... In our daughter\\'s case this is precisely what happened.\\n \\nThrough the Spell Read P.A.T. program, she was led forth from that I would term a very dismal state. For many years, Joanna has had to put enormous effort into her schoolwork. We believed that she had difficulty remembering and processing language. During her middle school years, we would spend an entire Sunday afternoon helping Joanna prepare for a test only to see her perform poorly. She was often reluctant to go to school. We never dreamed that her problems stemmed from poor phonological skills. Her freshman year in high school was extremely difficult for all of us.\\n \\nIn December of that year, Joanna was tested through SpellRead P.A.T. Test results indicated that Joanna\\'s word attack skills were at a fifth grade level and that her word identification skills were at an eighth grade level. It is no wonder that she had difficulty in school.\\n \\nShortly after the testing, Joanna began the SpellRead P.A.T. program\\u2014she was not to thrilled, I might add\\u2014and we began working with the most basic sounds. Initially, she didn\\'t particularly want to do it and didn\\'t really see how it would benefit her. This was a time when she had to trust that the program would help her. We persevered. As Joanna continued to work, I saw a change in her\\u2014as though an enormous weight had been lifted. As she continued in the program, Joanna herself realized that the program was benefitting in a huge way!\\n \\nBy summer\\'s end her word attack skills were at a college level and her word identification skills had risen three grade levels. This fall she was on the high honor roll at school. She continues to perform academically while playing a varsity sport and holding a part-time job.\\n \\nTo say that the SpellRead P.A.T. program has been life-changing may seem overly enthusiastic, but in reality it is an understatement. Our daughter\\'s self esteem has risen dramatically. She used to feel like something was wrong with her, like she just wasn\\'t very smart. She has shed many, many tears over the years. Now Joanna knows that she is smart. She is interested and engaged in the learning process. She is able to function independently. My only regret is that we did not know about SpellRead P.A.T. sooner.', 'I\\'ve seen such a huge improvement.  It is like night and day.  When I can get him to not be \"cool\" he has told me that reading has become much easier than it was last year.  I just can\\'t believe how quickly such a drastic, fundamental change in his reading ability was achieved.  We are all beyond appreciative!', 'I can\\'t fully express how joyful I am about Alise\\'s progress! As a person who has dyslexia I know how difficult it can be to decipher the letters on the page. I was very worried when I heard that she had the same issue; kind of hopeless. Beth and I have watched as your people transformed our little girl into an avid reader. She even picks up books on her own and reads for enjoyment! When I saw her score sheet today it brought tears to my eyes. What a wonderful feeling to know that your baby is going to be alright. Thank you.', 'This was life changing for our daughter. Books have gone from frustrating to fun!', 'The SpellRead program is a fascinating tool, and an unbelievable gift our children have received.', 'My child has all the tools he needs to read. Being dyslexic is no longer an issue. He is more confident and generally happier now that he can read!', 'Thank you for helping Anna open up a whole new world\\u2026now she has the KEY to learning. I know how hard you have all worked to make this happen and I am truly thankful!', 'Everyone, every single person in SpellRead was wonderful to my son. I cannot thank you enough for the gift you have given Andrew.', 'Kyle brought home his report card yesterday and we were blown away. At the end of the school year last year, in June, Kyle tested into reading level M which is either last quarter in Grade 2 or 1st quarter in Grade 3. Either way, well below grade level for a 5th grader.\\n\\nI am looking at his report card right now and it says he has tested on the V level which places him in 3rd quarter of 5th grade -- even more advanced than where he \"should be\" having just finished second quarter of 5th grade.\\n\\nAnyway, we just wanted to thank you: Joan, for the program, and Ron for your twice-weekly visits and hard work. We could never have imagined this kind of progress in such a short time. -- Allow me to second this. Danielle and I were just talking this week about how amazing Ron is with Kyle -- not just in teaching reading but navigating a distracted 10-11 year old through early morning lessons.\\n\\nThank you, thank you, thank you.', 'Adam came to our SpellRead office as a fourth grader in October of 2015. He was insecure in his reading and he also exhibited several speech articulation errors. Adam was growing embarrassed by his speech and struggling with the demands of fourth grade. His comfort level for reading was about a second grade level. \\n\\nIn spite of his struggles, Adam was a very hard worker. He WANTED to do well. Not without a few tears, Adam did all that we asked of him to improve his speech and his reading. He came twice a week, either before or after school and practiced the skills we taught him faithfully at home.\\n\\nThis month, Adam completed the third and final phase of SpellRead Intervention. He has beautiful speech. No more articulation issues. In addition, Adam is reading the Percy Jackson series. It is fifth grade material with a 6th-8th grade interest level.\\n\\nI would like to share an email exchange I had with his mom:\\n\\nMom: Did Gale tell you what Adam said to me when he got into my car after SpellRead?\\nMe: No, she did not tell me. What?\\nMom: He got in my car and gave me a giant hug. Then he told me that he loved me and thanked me for pushing him through SpellRead and not giving up on him!\\nMe: AWESOME!!!\\nMom: I almost cried.', 'Harry and I could not be more happy with Erika\\'s progress. While the test results made my eyes fill with tears, listening to her read really is the best part. She just got a 100 on her first book report homework.\\n\\nListening to her read is amazing. She has great retention and her writing has improved by leaps and bounds. She has an A in both reading and spelling.

Her reading problems had always been attributed to ESOL since she was adopted from China at age 6 years. She was finally diagnosed in 5th grade and was barely reading at a second grade level. It was devastating – and like many parents of LD children, I didn’t know where to turn. I was scared my daughter would never be able to read. I will always be grateful to Joan Collins, director of SpellRead of Greater Baltimore, for her infinite wisdom, vast experience, and proficient knowledge. She gave me hope and Spell Read gave my daughter the gift of reading. Spell Read  WORKS!!! I was amazed at my daughter’s quick and consistent progress.  After completing the program, Molly was reading at grade level and her word attack skills tested at the upper high school level. She is now in an advanced middle school curriculum and doing very well. She would never be at this point without Spell Read.  I would highly recommend this outstanding program. I wish that every child with a reading disability could experience the same gift that my daughter did – the belief in herself, and in her future.`, `My son, Griffin, struggled with reading...\n\nIn first grade Griffin was doing well in all aspects of school, except for reading. Watching his classmates progress through the reading levels while he was not caused his self-confidence to dwindle. Griffin was diagnosed with dyslexia. We placed him in a school for children with learning differences, that taught the Orton-Gillingham reading program. Although, Griffin did start progressing, it was a long, frustrating process.\n\nAt the beginning of third grade Griffin’s reading level was that of a second grader. He started the SpellRead program towards the end of September and by the beginning of March he was at a fourth grade reading level! He tackled two grade levels in six months!\n\nGriffin was able to return to mainstream school, reading at the level of his classmates. His self-confidence is back and he is a happy child that loves to read.\n\nSpellRead is an amazing program that we were fortunate enough to discover. I truly believe that without this program Griffin would still be struggling with reading and feeling frustrated about the whole learning process.`, `Educate from the Latin \"educare\" <related to \"educere\"> meaning to lead forth.... In our daughter's case this is precisely what happened.\n \nThrough the Spell Read P.A.T. program, she was led forth from that I would term a very dismal state. For many years, Joanna has had to put enormous effort into her schoolwork. We believed that she had difficulty remembering and processing language. During her middle school years, we would spend an entire Sunday afternoon helping Joanna prepare for a test only to see her perform poorly. She was often reluctant to go to school. We never dreamed that her problems stemmed from poor phonological skills. Her freshman year in high school was extremely difficult for all of us.\n \nIn December of that year, Joanna was tested through SpellRead P.A.T. Test results indicated that Joanna's word attack skills were at a fifth grade level and that her word identification skills were at an eighth grade level. It is no wonder that she had difficulty in school.\n \nShortly after the testing, Joanna began the SpellRead P.A.T. program—she was not to thrilled, I might add—and we began working with the most basic sounds. Initially, she didn't particularly want to do it and didn't really see how it would benefit her. This was a time when she had to trust that the program would help her. We persevered. As Joanna continued to work, I saw a change in her—as though an enormous weight had been lifted. As she continued in the program, Joanna herself realized that the program was benefitting in a huge way!\n \nBy summer's end her word attack skills were at a college level and her word identification skills had risen three grade levels. This fall she was on the high honor roll at school. She continues to perform academically while playing a varsity sport and holding a part-time job.\n \nTo say that the SpellRead P.A.T. program has been life-changing may seem overly enthusiastic, but in reality it is an understatement. Our daughter's self esteem has risen dramatically. She used to feel like something was wrong with her, like she just wasn't very smart. She has shed many, many tears over the years. Now Joanna knows that she is smart. She is interested and engaged in the learning process. She is able to function independently. My only regret is that we did not know about SpellRead P.A.T. sooner.`, `I've seen such a huge improvement.  It is like night and day.  When I can get him to not be \"cool\" he has told me that reading has become much easier than it was last year.  I just can't believe how quickly such a drastic, fundamental change in his reading ability was achieved.  We are all beyond appreciative!`, `I can't fully express how joyful I am about Alise's progress! As a person who has dyslexia I know how difficult it can be to decipher the letters on the page. I was very worried when I heard that she had the same issue; kind of hopeless. Beth and I have watched as your people transformed our little girl into an avid reader. She even picks up books on her own and reads for enjoyment! When I saw her score sheet today it brought tears to my eyes. What a wonderful feeling to know that your baby is going to be alright. Thank you.`, `This was life changing for our daughter. Books have gone from frustrating to fun!`, `The SpellRead program is a fascinating tool, and an unbelievable gift our children have received.`, `My child has all the tools he needs to read. Being dyslexic is no longer an issue. He is more confident and generally happier now that he can read!`, `Thank you for helping Anna open up a whole new world…now she has the KEY to learning. I know how hard you have all worked to make this happen and I am truly thankful!`, `Everyone, every single person in SpellRead was wonderful to my son. I cannot thank you enough for the gift you have given Andrew.`, `Kyle brought home his report card yesterday and we were blown away. At the end of the school year last year, in June, Kyle tested into reading level M which is either last quarter in Grade 2 or 1st quarter in Grade 3. Either way, well below grade level for a 5th grader.\n\nI am looking at his report card right now and it says he has tested on the V level which places him in 3rd quarter of 5th grade -- even more advanced than where he \"should be\" having just finished second quarter of 5th grade.\n\nAnyway, we just wanted to thank you: Joan, for the program, and Ron for your twice-weekly visits and hard work. We could never have imagined this kind of progress in such a short time. -- Allow me to second this. Danielle and I were just talking this week about how amazing Ron is with Kyle -- not just in teaching reading but navigating a distracted 10-11 year old through early morning lessons.\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you.`, `Adam came to our SpellRead office as a fourth grader in October of 2015. He was insecure in his reading and he also exhibited several speech articulation errors. Adam was growing embarrassed by his speech and struggling with the demands of fourth grade. His comfort level for reading was about a second grade level. \n\nIn spite of his struggles, Adam was a very hard worker. He WANTED to do well. Not without a few tears, Adam did all that we asked of him to improve his speech and his reading. He came twice a week, either before or after school and practiced the skills we taught him faithfully at home.\n\nThis month, Adam completed the third and final phase of SpellRead Intervention. He has beautiful speech. No more articulation issues. In addition, Adam is reading the Percy Jackson series. It is fifth grade material with a 6th-8th grade interest level.\n\nI would like to share an email exchange I had with his mom:\n\nMom: Did Gale tell you what Adam said to me when he got into my car after SpellRead?\nMe: No, she did not tell me. What?\nMom: He got in my car and gave me a giant hug. Then he told me that he loved me and thanked me for pushing him through SpellRead and not giving up on him!\nMe: AWESOME!!!\nMom: I almost cried.`, `Harry and I could not be more happy with Erika's progress. While the test results made my eyes fill with tears, listening to her read really is the best part. She just got a 100 on her first book report homework.\n\nListening to her read is amazing. She has great retention and her writing has improved by leaps and bounds. She has an A in both reading and spelling. She is also retaining her ability to spell most of the words she has learned.`, `We are very pleased with the end results of the program.
